This is a spring based web application. The reason of this project is to test out the REST part of spring and to do the same things I have done before using the REST as provided through Spring. 

This is still a work in Progress. I have taken up the idea of an Human Resource application (Employee Management as well as Procurement Portal), This will be perhaps either embedded or added to the activiti project to use the Procuremnt process as an example.
