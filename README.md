GitSVNRepo
==========

This is my play area. Here I add the projects where I try out different features or technologies
or frameworks or even a new language if I get the time. 

If you need to critique or code review and give suggestions, I am all open for it as this is the way to learn and correct
those bad habits or wrong techniques that one can acquire over the years.
